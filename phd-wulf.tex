\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis is concerned with three different directions of generalization of clasic combinatorial optimization problems: Robust optimization, higher-order cost functions, and nonpreemption.

In the first part of the thesis, we consider recoverable robust oprimization in conjunction with the representative selection problem and discrete budgeted uncertainty. 
This is a problem which is trivial without the presence of any robustness, but the addition of robustness makes it challenging. 
Determining the computational hardness of the specific variant that we consider has been an open question since 2011, which we now resolve by showing NP-completeness. We also show that the corresponding adversarial problem can be solved in polynomial time.

We furthermore consider multi-stage robust optimization, specifically recoverable robust optimization and two-stage adjustable robust optimization. We make a compelling case that the natural complexity class for many problems studied in the literature is the class $\Sigma^p_3$ from the polynomial hierarchy. Despite this, very few $\Sigma^p_3$-completeness results are known. We make a first step by showing several results of this kind.

We also consider network interdiction problems, specifically with respect to interval graphs. We introduce a framework for interdiction on interval graphs, which allows one to shrink or expand intervals. We show that the well-known most vital nodes problem is a special case of the framework. Even though network interdiction problems are often times NP-complete or even harder, in our case we obtain polynomial-time algorithms for 6 of the 8 cases studied. This is done employing technically challenging dynamic programs. One of our results answers an open question by Diner et al. 

In the second part of the thesis, we consider linearization of the quadratic shortest path problem. In an earlier paper, Sotirov and Hu gave an example of a certain directed graph with a peculiar property, which we call unviersally linearizable. Motivated by this example, we give a complete characterization of the class of universally linearizable directed graphs. 

Inspired by some insight gained from the characterization,
we find an algorithm that solves the linearization problem of the quadratic shortest path problem on acyclic directed graphs in running time $O(m^2)$. 
There is also a trivial tight lower bound of $\Omega(m^2)$, making our algorithm linear-time. 
In contrast, the fastest previous algorithm was presented by Hu qand Sotirov and has a running time of $O(nm^3)$. Hence we improve the state-of-the art by a factor of $O(mn)$. Our algorithm is based on a surprising new insight, stating that linearizability of an acyclic directed graph can be understood as a local property.  Our approach generalizes to the case of cost functions of degree higher than $d$, where we also obtain a linear-time algorithm.

In the final part of the thesis, we consider the problem of keeping a graph connected for a maximal amount of time, by scheduling its edges in a non-preemptive way. 
%Specifically, every edge $e$ has a weight $w(e)$ attached to it, and can be scheduled during a non-interrupted interval of length $w(e)$. The goal is to maximize the time during which the scheduled edges span all the vertices. 
We show that the problem is an interesting mixture between a scheduling problem and the graph-structural problem of tree-packing, as introduced by Nash-Williams. We derive a variety of complexity results for the problem.

\chapter*{\germanenglish{Danksagung}{Acknowledgements}}

First and foremost, I want to thank to my advisor Bettina Klinz, who was always available for any kind of questions or problems that occured and helped resolve them, even on short notice. I would also like to express my gratitude for the trust she placed in me, letting me choose my own topics and collaborations, and supporting me in every way while doing so.

Modern research is impossible without collaborators, hence I am indepted to all my co-authors and collaborators for all the enriching scientific discussions, surprising insights, deep knowledge and exciting collaborations. Namely, these co-authors are Reni \c{C}ela, Anita Dürr, Nicolas El Maalouly, Marc Goerigk, Dorothee Henke, Hung P. Hoang, Bettina Klinz, James B Orlin, Gerhard Woeginger

Special thanks to Nicolas, Marc, Dorothee, and Hung for bringing their great academic expertise to me by visiting Graz. All of these visits resulted in published (or soon-to-be-published) work. I would also like to thank my host Bernd Gärtner at ETH Zurich, whose group I could gratiously visit for three months in April 2022.

I am very lucky for Stefan being my mentor, who introduced me to both the world of robust optimization, and the strange world of academia in general. Working together with Stefan is immensely motivating and productive, as indicated by our amount of shared papers. 
Likewise, I thank Michael Kerber, my second mentor, for giving helpful advise around all kinds of situations in academic life. 
I would like to thank all my colleagues at TU Graz. In particular, this our secretaries Karin Kernbichler and Maria Urdl-Müller. This thesis is also written in memory of Gerhard, who tragically passed away after a long illness in April 2022. Gerhard was a frequent visitor to Graz, and his visits were the initial spark for the research behind \cref{ch:linearization-1,ch:linearization-2} in this thesis. Furthermore, his strcutural insights and his deep understanding of how write and explain a scientific paper greatly improved the quality of \cref{ch:ntp}. Indeed, Gerhard was an expert in many areas of mathematics and academia in general, and he left us too soon.

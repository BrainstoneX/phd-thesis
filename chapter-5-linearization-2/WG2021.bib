abstract="The quadratic shortest path problem (QSPP) in a directed graph asks for a directed path from a given source vertex to a given sink vertex, so that the sum of the interaction costs over all pairs of arcs on the path is minimized. We consider special cases of the QSPP that are linearizable as a shortest path problem in the sense of Bookhold. If the QSPP on a directed graph is linearizable under all possible choices of the arc interaction costs, the graph is called universally linearizable.",
